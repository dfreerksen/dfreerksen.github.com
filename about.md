I've never been good at talking about myself. Some people are afraid of public speaking. I am afraid I will put people to sleep talking about myself.

My name is David Freerksen. I was raised in Texas. I joined the Marine Corps in 2003 as an infantry mortarman. I was combat deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. I got off active duty in 2007. In 2008 I moved to California. I currently live in Elk Grove, California with my wife and three dogs.

I am a Senior Software Engineer for <a href="http://groundctrl.com" target="_blank">ground(ctrl)</a> in Sacramento where I work with Rails and PHP. Most of the work I do there is in the realm of Rails and/or Spree.

In my free time I work on code, go to the gym, and watch movies on Netflix.
