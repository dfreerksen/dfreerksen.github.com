I’m David. I’m a husband, a developer and a pet lover.

I was raised in Texas. I joined the Marine Corps in 2003 as an infantry mortarman. I was combat deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. In 2008 I moved to California. I live in Elk Grove, California with my wife and three dogs.

I’ve been making software for about {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2002 }} years now. The last couple of years using Ruby.

I am a Senior Software Engineer for <a href="http://wonderfulunion.com" target="_blank">Wonderful Union</a>, formerly known as ground(ctrl), in Sacramento where I work with Rails and PHP. Most of the work I do there is in the realm of Rails and/or Spree.

In my free time I work on code, go to the gym, and watch movies on Netflix.
