I’m David. I’m a developer, a veteran and a dog lover.

I was raised in Texas. I joined the Marine Corps in 2003 as an infantry mortarman. I was combat deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. In 2008 I moved to California. I currently live in Elk Grove, California with my three dogs.

I’ve been making software for about {{ site.time | date: "%Y" | minus: 2001 }} years now. The last few years using mostly Ruby.

I am a Senior Software Engineer for [Wonderful Union][wun], formerly known as [ground(ctrl)][gctrl], in Sacramento where I work with Rails and PHP. Most of the work I do there is in the realm of Rails and/or Spree.

In my free time I work on code, go to the gym, and watch movies on Netflix.

You can [view my resume][resume].
