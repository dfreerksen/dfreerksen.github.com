I recently found <a href="http://www.cabel.name/2008/02/fancyzoom-10.html" target="_blank">FancyZoom 1.1</a> which is the Mac-esque version of <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/" target="_blank">Lightbox</a> or <a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/" target="_blank">Thickbox</a>. I like it and I think it has a lot of potential. The pros and the cons:

Pros:

1.  It doesn't black out the entire screen to display the image.
2.  Allows you to be able to click on other images or links that are on the screen while the image is open.
3.  Very much styled after the Mac.

Cons:

1.  Only works with images.
2.  All image links on the page will display using the zoom, not specific ones with a CSS or piece of Javascript attached to the link.
3.  Every once in a while the loading image doesn't display and you get a strange white box with the 'X' in the top left corner because either the image can't load or hasn't loaded.
4.  Very much styled after the Mac.

I wonder what would happen to it is you linked to an image that wasn't there? Does anyone know what would happen? I'm too lazy to find out for myself.
