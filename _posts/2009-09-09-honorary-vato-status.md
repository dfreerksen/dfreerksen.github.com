When I was in the military, right before we deployed to Afghanistan, I was living with a good friend of mine. He's Mexican. That little bit of information will come in to play later. We had just finished a 7 week training operation in the mountains in Nevada. When we finally got back to our base after the op was finished, we did what any normal Marine does; drink.

Sometime during the night, he called up a girl he knew from back home. After about 10 minutes of talking he handed me the phone and said he had to go to the bathroom and told me to talk to her. This is how the conversation went:

**Me**: Hi. I'm David

**Her**: Hi David

**Me**: I'm white...

*[My friend and her both laugh]*

**Me**: ...but that's alright. Because I'm an honorary vato.

I have no idea why I said that. Everyone thought it was funny though. Because of those last few words, my friend still refers to me as an honorary vato.

Four years later, another friend of mine decided to make an Honorary Vato certificate for me to print and hang on my wall. And you know I'll do it too!
