I've been horrible with making posts. I keep forgetting or I tell myself I'll do it tomorrow. I'll try to do better from now on.

Soon to come though, at some point I want to switch away from WordPress and build this site on PyroCMS. PyroCMS is build on Codeigniter, which I love and know try well. So maybe I can build some plugins for it after I switch over. I'm also learning Backbone.js and Node.js so that should be interesting. Eventually I'll post code also.
