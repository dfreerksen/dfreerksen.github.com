I've always been a big fan of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tweener/" target="_blank">Tweener</a>. Even when it was called MC Tween I thought it was one of the best tween managers for Flash. Yesterday I found something that might compete with Tweener. It's called <a href="http://blog.greensock.com/tweenmaxas3/" target="_blank">TweenMax</a>. There are three version of TweenMax. TweenLite (3k) does the basic tweens. The same as Tweener really. TweenFilterLite (6k) does what TweenLite does, plus it tweens the filters like Blur, Glow, Bevel, ColorMatrix, and DropShadow and also tweens saturation, hue, brightness, contrast, threshold, and colorization. Then there is TweenMax (8k) which includes everything the other two do a few extra things. One of the best things about it is it can do *bezier* tweening! How cool is that! If you go to the <a href="http://blog.greensock.com/tweening-family-comparison/" target="_blank">Family Comparison</a> you can see the list of things each one has or doesn't have and even see demos of them compared to other tween managers.
