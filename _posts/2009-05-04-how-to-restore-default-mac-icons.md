Wow. Mac icons are tricky. Everything has to be exact in order to work correctly.

I decided I wanted to pimp out my Mac by changing the icons of the HD and Time Machine. I started with Time Machine. I wanted to change it to the DeLorean from Back to the Future. Nerdy, I know.

It turns out I didn't like the way it looked and I just wanted to go back to the default icon. The problem was, I don't know where that icon lived. And when I found an PNG of of the icon, all that did was change the Time Machine icon to a PNG icon. Not the PNG image but the icon of a PNG file type.

Getting the default icon back was super easy. Well, at first it wasn't easy.

If you right click on the Time Machine drive and go to Get Info, there is an icon in the top left corner. Click and hold until there is a slight blue glow around it. Tap the delete key. Done.

That's all I had to do. It changed the icon back to the default icon. An hour of searching the web trying to figure out how to get the default icon back and all I had to do was press one key.
