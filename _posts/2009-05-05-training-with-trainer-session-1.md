Damn! I'm worn out. I got there at 7am this morning and started. He started by measuring my body fat percentages. That took about half an hour. After that we went to the floor and started working out. I only worked out for 30-45 minutes and I am just physically drained. The trainers name is Charlie. He's pretty knowledgeable. So if you are in the Sacramento area and looking for a trainer, give him a call at 24 Hour Fitness I'll post later on today about my body fat measurements. I'm too tired to do it right now.
