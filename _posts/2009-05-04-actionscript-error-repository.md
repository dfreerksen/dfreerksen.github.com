I found a great resource today called the <a href="http://www.actionscripterrors.com" target="_blank">ActionScript Error Repository</a>. Let's say you are working in Flash, Flex, or AIR and you get a fun error message: *Error #2032: Stream Error*. You can search for the error code and it will explain the cause and how to fix it. It will give an example of bad that that will cause a similar error and it will also give you an example of good code that you can copy/paste.
