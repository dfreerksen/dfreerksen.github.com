<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-634" title="Magic Mouse" src="/assets/images/posts/2010/01/magic_mouse-150x44.png" alt="" width="150" height="44" />When I first updated to Snow Leopard I was using a Logitech mouse. But I kept having problems with it. Some of the time it would read my single clicks as double clicks. So if I was selecting a bunch of files to be deleted, it would then open them all up. It became very annoying. So I started using the Mighty Mouse until the Magic Mouse came out. I use the Magic Mouse exclusively now.

I have to say the Magic Mouse is almost the best mouse I have ever had. I say almost because with both the Logitech mouse and Mighty Mouse, I had a way to do application Exposé without touching the keyboard. For most people, this isn't a big deal. But I spend a lot of time on the computer. Shortcuts like that really help.

I'm pretty sure Apple is working on updating the Magic Muse driver to do it now, but in the mean time, you can use <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/" target="_blank">BetterTouchTool</a>. I have it set right now to three finger click opens up Exposé. I can easily change it to a two, three, four, or five finger click, or tap, or swipe. It's a pretty nice little program. If you gave a Magic Mouse, I recommend you try it out.

Even if you don't have a Magic Mouse, you can still use it on multitouch touchpads on the Macbook and Macbook Pro.

[Update Jan. 11th, 2009] There is also <a title="MagicPrefs" href="http://vladalexa.com/apps/osx/magicprefs/" target="_blank">MagicPrefs</a> which looks like it does the same thing. I haven't tried it because BTT is working great for me.
