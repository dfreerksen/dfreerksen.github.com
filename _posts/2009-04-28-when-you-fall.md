The worst part about falling when you are running is when no one else is around. Because you still feel like an idiot. But now you feel like an idiot and no one else is around. So it's you that thinks you are an idiot.

I was taking my dog for a walk this morning. At the end of the walk we run to my apartment door. I was running on a rail. I know, bad idea. On my left is a small up hill. On my right was a 3 foot drop to where the sidewalk is. Somehow I fell off and scraped up my left leg.

So no more running on rails for me!
