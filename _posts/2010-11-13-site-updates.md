It only took me 5 months but I finally updated the site from WordPress 2.9 to Wordpress 3. I wanted to redesign the theme to work better with the new features in WordPress 3. At the same time, I updated some functionality. I also removed the dropdown navigation in the menu. I also moved the site from a Windows server to a Linux server. Now I can take advantage of .htaccess files.
