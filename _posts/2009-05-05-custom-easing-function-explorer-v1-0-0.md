A couple weeks ago I was looking for a quick customization to the default tweens in Flex. Basically I didn't want the Bounce to bounce as much as it was. I don't know math well enough to make it do what I wanted so I just went with second best. Yesterday I was surfing around and I found exactly what I needed. It's called <a href="http://www.madeinflex.com/img/entries/2007/05/customeasingexplorer.html" target="_blank">Custom Easing Function Explorer</a>. Which of course linked off to the <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/201/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=LiveDocs_Book_Parts&file=behaviors_068_28.html#218121" target="_blank">Adobe docs</a> on the same subject. Funny how I couldn't find that when I actually needed it.
