I've never really been big into my birthday. For me, it's just another day. I guess my birthday is so close to Thanksgiving that people tend to forget. I just realize people have other things on their minds. That doesn't mean I am bitter though.

But I do have to admit, there are certain people that I had hoped would remember. There is always at least one person that, even though you don't talk too much, you hope they send you a text, or an email, or call. One person in particular I hoped would say something but didn't.

I always kept it in the back of my mind that it probably won't happen. And when it didn't, I admit, it did sting a little. But I also know that we just aren't as close as we used to be.
