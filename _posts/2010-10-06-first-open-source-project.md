I just signed up for an account with <a href="http://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> and created my first project. I am going to be creating an open source bug tracker built on <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/" target="_blank">Codeigniter</a> 2. I am going to model it based on <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/" target="_blank">JIRA</a> which is a JSP bug tracker, but I have a few more plans for it. It's just started on it and there isn't much to see just yet. Just give me time. I am using <a href="http://jasonfharris.com/machg/" target="_blank">MacHG</a> to do all of my Mercurial commits.

I am also gearing up towards working on an open source CMS based on Codeigniter named <a href="http://combustioncms.com/" target="_blank">Combustion CMS</a>.
