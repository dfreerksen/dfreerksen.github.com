I just figured out how to add friends on Mario Kart for the Wii. I just played a friend of mine in Dallas. It was a lot of fun! So if anyone wants to race me sometime, let me know. My Mario Kart friend ID is 0173-2074-0436. Also, if if you want to add me to your friends on the Wii console itself, give me a comment and give me your Wii ID. Mine is 2352-5065-0914-9964.
