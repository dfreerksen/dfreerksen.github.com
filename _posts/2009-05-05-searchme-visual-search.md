I thought this was pretty cool. I play with it for about an hour when I first found it. <a href="http://www.searchme.com/" target="_blank">Searchme</a> is a search engine with a twist. Instead of showing a list of text based results, it visually shows the results. I guess it's a screenshot of the website and displayed in the iTunes CoverFlow type design. You just have to see it for yourself.

[Update July 28, 2008] I just came across <a href="http://www.viewzi.com/" target="_blank">Viewzi</a> which is supposed to be the same type of thing as Searchme. To be honest with you I think it's broken. I searched for "david" and got some completely unrelated stuff. The first link was a few recent news articles. None of which had the word "david" in them.
