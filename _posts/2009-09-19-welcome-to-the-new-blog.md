It's official. I have moved to WordPress. I used to be on Mango Blog but decided to switch over to WordPress when I decided to start learning PHP. I'll be migrating all of the Mango Blog posts over to WordPress. If what you are looking for isn't here yet, come back tomorrow and it may be back up by then.

[Update] I am adding in some of my previous posts (manually of course), and for some reason Mango Blog had a bunch of my posts in May. I'd say 3/4 of my posts were in May. Which isn't right. Mango Blog went screwy somewhere.
