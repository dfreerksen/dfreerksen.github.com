After I found this, I spent the next 3 hours looking up websites. It's call the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive#Wayback_Machine" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. Not to be confused with the time machine from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_machine" target="_blank">Rocky and Bullwinkle Show</a>.

What it does is allows you to look at old versions of a website. Some of the images won't be displayed but it still works pretty well. It's funny to look at older versions of websites.

Check out <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981202230410/http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google.com from back in December 1998</a>.
