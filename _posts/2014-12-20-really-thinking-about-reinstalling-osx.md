I've been having a lot of problems with my machine lately. Brew is screwed up. Git is pointing to the wrong path. My machine thinks I have RVM installed, though it has never been installed. The lock screen shows just a grey screen instead of the login screen. When I type my password it works though. I think it's time to wipe it and reinstall. Maybe I'll give <a href="https://github.com/boxen/" target="_blank">Boxen</a> a shot this time.
