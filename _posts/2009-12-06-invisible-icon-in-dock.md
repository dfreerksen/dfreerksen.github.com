I went to an office Christmas party today. When I got back from the party, my Safari icon was done. The Safari application wasn't gone because I could still open Safari and go to websites.Â  The icon was just transparent.

I removed it from the dock and put it back in thinking that would do the trick. It didn't.

So I tried the official Windows fix and restarted. The icon was still in the dock at this time. That still didn't fix the problem. So I removed the icon from the dock again and then put it back in the dock and it started showing up again.

I assume restarting the computer then adding the icon back in the dock solved the issue but I can't be sure because the icon is displaying now and I don't know how to make the ico transparent again.
