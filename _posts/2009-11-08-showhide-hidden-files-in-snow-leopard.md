A while back I posted a way to [show/hide hidden files in Leopard]({% post_url 2009-05-05-showhide-hidden-files-in-os-x %}). Now that I am using Snow Leopard and needed to see the hidden files, I went in search of a more elegant way to accomplish this. Read <a href="http://artofgeek.com/2009/09/16/toggle-display-of-hidden-files-in-finder-with-keyboard-shortcut/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>. It's pretty much the same steps. It also includes optional steps to add a keyboard shortcut so that you don't have to go to the services menu to toggle the hidden files.

This time, in Snow Leopard, when you toggle the hidden files, it is much quicker and it doesn't close out all of your open Finder windows. It relocates them to the last Space but at least it's not closing them.
