I celebrate every year on Pi Day. By eating pie. This is a special year though.

In case you are out of school and have forgotten everything about math, Pi (&pi;) is a mathematical constant that describes the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it represents an infinite string of numbers. And if you are still lost, you'll know it as 3.14.

As I said, this year is important. Every century (100 years), there is only one day that will line up with the first ten digits of Pi. Most people celebrate that moment on 3/14/15 at either 9:26:53 a.m. and/or 9:26:53 p.m. I prefer to celebrate at 9:26:53 a.m. because 9p.m. on the 24 hour clock is 21 and that no longer makes sense with Pi (though neither does 09). Plus this allows me to eat pie for breakfast.

The next year that will be so nerdy/important is in the year 2115.

Bone up on your [Pi knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) while you eat some pie!
