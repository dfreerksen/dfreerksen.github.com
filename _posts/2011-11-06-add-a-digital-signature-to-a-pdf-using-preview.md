Apple always builds all kinds of hidden things into their stuff. Today I had to sign a contract. The contract was sent over as a PDF. I really didn't want to print it, sign it, and mail or fax it back or rescan it and email it back. I don't have a scanner and I don't have a printer. I started playing with Preview and it turns out, it's built in now. This is available in Lion.

1. Open the PDF that needs a signature with Preview.
2. Click the **Annotate** tab to display the annotate toolbar.
3. Select the **Signature** button.
4. If you do not have a signature loaded already, click **Create Signature from Built-In iSight...**. If you already have one loaded, skip to step 7

5. In the **Signatures** tab, click **Create Signature...**
6. Sign your name to a white piece of paper and hold it up to your iSight camera.
7. Click **Accept** when your signature is positioned correctly inside the preview area.

8. With the Signature button selected (it should be blue), click and drag where you want to place your signature.
