I was thinking about some of the sites I have worked on. I started trying to remember the very first website I worked on as a professional developer. I couldn't remember what it was. Keep in mind this was back in 1998 so it has been a while. So I messaged my old boss and asked him.

The very first website that I ever worked on was an event calendar. A lady just found out her daughter was a lesbian. In order to be supportive, we decided to make a website of all of the upcoming events in gay and lesbian community. Unfortunately, the site is no longer online. It would have been fun to see how it had progressed since I last worked on it.
