If you have ever worked with XML and Safari, you know that Safari doesn't display XML in the browser the way Firefox or IE does. It treats XML nodes as HTML tags and everything between the beginning and end tags it throws on the page which created a big jumbled mess. The only way to see the XML so it is in a readable format is to view the source of the XML file in the browser. Doing so you aren't able to expand or collapse nodes.

That was until I found the <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/xmlviewplugin/" target="_blank">XML View Plugin</a> for Safari. This is a Mac OS X 10.5 or better plugin. Simply copy the plugin into the /Library/Internet Plug-ins folder and restart Safari.

If you aren't happy with the colors or the functionality of the plugin, you can exit that to your specific likes.
