I've always been a big fan of the <a href="http://examples.adobe.com/flex3/consulting/styleexplorer/Flex3StyleExplorer.html" target="_blank">Flex Style Explorer</a>. I use it almost on a daily basic. But I've now run across more explorers. The first is the <a href="http://www.merhl.com/flex2_samples/filterExplorer/" target="_blank">Flex Filter Explorer</a>. I think the biggest issue I have with this one is it only shows the MXML code and not the Actionscript code. The next and final explorer is the <a href="http://www.flexibleexperiments.com/Flex/PrimitiveExplorer/Flex2PrimitiveExplorer.html" target="_blank">Flex Primitive Explorer</a>. This one does primitive shapes using the Graphics class.
