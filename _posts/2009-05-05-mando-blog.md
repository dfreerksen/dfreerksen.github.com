Welcome to v4 of my blog! Sort of. The first version I made myself. After 5 years of using it, it became weak and sloppy. So I moved to CFBloggy. The person that wrote that pissed me off by not answering my questions. So then I moved to <a href="http://www.blogcfc.com" target="_blank">BlogCFC</a>. I hadn't even released the BlogCFC version when someone told me about the greatness that is <a href="http://www.mangoblog.org/" target="_blank">Mango Blog</a>. It's only about a year old but it seems like features for it are going to be coming down for it left and right. So I decided to jump on the bandwagon now. My biggest problem with it is code blocks. You have to disable Javascript in order to add a block of code so it colors it. Once you have submitted the post you can re-enable Javascript. What a hassle!
