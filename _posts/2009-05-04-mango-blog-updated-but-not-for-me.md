Mango Blog 1.2.2 came out a couple days ago. I went to upgrade to it and it was a day long issue trying to get my blog back up and running. What I eventually had to do was revert back to Mango Blog 1.1. But I did make the design more wide. Before it was using an 800x600 design. I changed it to 1024x768. I am also going to start posting my source code pretty soon. Stay tuned for that.
