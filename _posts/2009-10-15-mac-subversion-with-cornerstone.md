When I upgraded my Mac from Leopard to Snow Leopard, the only thing that really changed for me was I had to updated a couple pieces of software or wait about a week for the software to be updated. There were two things that could not be updated. The first was a plugin called <a href="http://www.growlichat.com/NuFile.php" target="_blank">NuFile</a> that I used to create new files and <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/" target="_blank">SCPlugin</a> that I used for subversion. Both used the context (right click) menu. Unfortunately, Snow Leopard changed the way that context menus are done. Apple now wants software developer to use the services menu instead. So for now, both are dead in Snow Leopard.

To get around the NuFile problem of creating a new file, I am using <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/" target="_blank">QuickSilver</a> to open the application and then save the file wherever I want it. Or saving the file to the desktop and dragging it into the folder where I want it. Not as quick as the context menu but it gets the job done.

As far as SCPlugin is concerned, I needed a subversion app right away. So I started downloading a bunch of them to see which one I liked the best. A lot of them didn't run on Snow Leopard. The ones that did, they were too complicated and it annoyed me or they didn't notify me if there was an update. Which is important to me. I don't want to check for an update manually. I wanted the app to check for an update and then left me update it if and when I wanted. I liked svnX up until I wanted to add a folder with 4 levels of sub folders in it and one file inside of the last folder. I ended up having to add the folders one by one. So I dropped that right after that experience. Plus it was difficult to get to work with repositories that required a username and password. You would have to go to Terminal to accept the certificate.

Then I landed on <a href="http://versionsapp.com/" target="_blank">Versions</a> which everyone thinks is the greatest subversion app for the Mac. I tried it out. It was good. Much better than all of the other subversion applications I had tried previously.

It did everything Versions did, but it did it better and quicker. It has a very nice inline content viewer as well. It also felt smoother and more stable to me. It also plays nice with repositories that require you to log in with a username and password and also saves the information in the keychain. Both are about the same price (Cornerstone is only $1 cheaper). Now that I have Cornerstone and see its power, I don't even see myself going back to SCPlugin even if/when they update to work with Snow Leopard.
