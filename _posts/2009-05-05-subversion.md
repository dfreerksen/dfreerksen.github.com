I was wondering what other subversion tools were used. For the PC I use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a>. I know Flex comes with a plugin for Eclipse called <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subclipse</a>. I've tried it and I'm not a fan of that one. To me it seems likes it says it updates but it doesn't fully complete. For the Mac I use <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/" target="_blank">SCPlugin</a>. I've been pretty happy with it so far. There are a couple quarks but for the most part it's pretty good. What else is out there?
