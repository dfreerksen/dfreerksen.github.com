My second hard drive crashed today. While I was working, out of nowhere, my computer locks up. Not a big deal right? Windows does that every now and again. So I had to do a hard shutdown. When I go to boot it back up I get "Operating System not found." Not good news. So I spend all day trying to get my data off my primary drive. As it turns out, it was the second hard drive that crash and not the primary. So I bought a new second hard drive and put that in. But now the problem remains of getting my data off of the drive that crashed. I got a hard drive enclosure so I can get the files off of it but it's not being recognized still. So I read online about people putting their hard drives in the freezer. For some reason it works. So it's in the freezer right now and I'll keeping my fingers crossed.
