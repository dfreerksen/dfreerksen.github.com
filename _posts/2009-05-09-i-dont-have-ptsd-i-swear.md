I was at work today and got a phone call from someone wanting to do a phone interview about my combat deployment. It was basically a bunch of questions about the status about my health (mental and physical) since I came back from deployment. I did a similar one after I cam back from the deployment in 2006. Why they needed to do another one three years later, I don't know.

I answered all of her questions and at the end she said she wanted to transfer me to someone else because I show signs of having PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).

First of all, I don't like someone I have never met telling me over the phone that I may have PTSD all because of the way I answered some questions. Second of all, I don't even like being lumped into that kind of category.

Big deal if I have dreams every now and then. It was a combat deployment. It was a series of significant events in my life. And who cares if I try to avoid situations where I think something might remind me of something that happened over there. I just don't want to deal with it.

The one thing that I will give her though is this. I sometimes feel disconnected from others. Like there is a difference between them and me. Not the "I'm a Marine and you aren't and I'm better than you" kind of difference. More of a feeling that people won't understand.
