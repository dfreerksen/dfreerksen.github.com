To save yourself a little bit of embarrassment I am going to give you a little bit of a tip. "Pot Stickers" is a food. It's a yummyÂ Chinese food. It is not a sticker with a marijuana leaf on it. So when someone someone asks you if you like Post Stickers or if you saw the Pot Stickers or anything along those lines, they are talking about food.
