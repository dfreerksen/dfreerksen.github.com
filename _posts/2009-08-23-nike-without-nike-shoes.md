I love <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/" target="_blank">Nike+</a>. It keeps me motivated to run. The only problem I have is that I don't like Nike shoes. I prefer Adidas over Nike shoes any day. They fit me so much better. But Adidas doesn't make shoes for the Nike+ sensor (obviously) so I have been forced to buy Nike shoes. Until now.

I just found the <a href="http://switcheasy.com/products/Runaway/Runaway.php" target="_blank">Runaway</a> from <a href="http://switcheasy.com/" target="_blank">SwitchEasy</a>. It allows you to clip the Nike+ sensor to laces on top of your shoes. It is even waterproof so you can run in the rain (I always thought that was fun). And best of all, it only costs $8.99. So goodbye Nike shoes. Hello, Adidas!
