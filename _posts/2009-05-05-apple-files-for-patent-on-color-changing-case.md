I hope to God this happens because this would just be really cool.

Apple has filed for a patent that is a "computing device with dynamic ornamental appearance." The idea being for the casing of electronic devices, such as an iPod or a Mac computer, to be able to change colors. "For example, the light may be used to exhibit a housing behavior that reflects the desires or moods of the user, that reflects inputs or outputs for the electronic device, or that reacts to tasks or events associated with operation of the electronic device."

Here is a direct quote:  
"The invention pertains to electronic devices capable of dynamically changing their ornamental or decorative appearance, i.e., the outer appearance as seen by a user. The electronic devices generally include an illuminable housing. The illuminable housing, which includes at least one wall configured for the passage of light, is configured to enclose, cover and protect a light arrangement as well as functional components of the electronic device. The light arrangement, which generally includes one or more light sources, is configured to produce light for transmission through the light passing wall(s) of the illuminable housing. The transmitted light illuminates the wall(s) thus giving the wall a new appearance. That is, the transmitted light effectively alters the ornamental or decorative appearance of the electronic device. In most cases, the light is controlled so as to produce a light effect having specific characteristics or attributes. As such, the electronic device may be configured to provide additional feedback to the user of the electronic device and to give users the ability to personalize or change the look of their electronic device on an on-going basis. That is, a housing of the electronic device is active rather than passive, i.e., the housing has the ability to adapt and change. For example, the light may be used to exhibit a housing behavior that reflects the desires or moods of the user, that reflects inputs or outputs for the electronic device, or that reacts to tasks or events associated with operation of the electronic device."

Think of your Mac or iPod as an expensive mood ring.

One one hand, how bad ass would it be to color code your iPod to your outfit for the day or have your Mac turn red when an error has occurred? On the other hand, why more eye candy? Why should Apple be playing with colors and lights instead of making their already fast OS even faster? I guess you haven't heard that Max OS X Snow Leopard supports up to 16 Terabytes (theoretical) of RAM? Which mean you could run your entire OS in memory if you wanted.
