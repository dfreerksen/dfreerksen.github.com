<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-398" style="margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;" title="Logitech MX 620 Cordless Laser Mouse" src="/assets/images/posts/2009/10/logitech-mx-620.png" alt="Logitech MX 620 Cordless Laser Mouse" width="115" height="211" />I was having problems with my mouse. I have a Logitech MX 620 Cordless Laser Mouse on my home Mac OS X 10.6.1 Snow Leopard MacBook Pro that was upgraded from Leopard.

Many times, when I single left click, it decides to double click instead. The double click happens instantly like it sees my single click as a double click. This double click doesn't happen all of the time. I checked all of the preferences and even deleted all Logitech preference files from the /Users/USERNAME/Library/Preference/ folder that started with "com.Logitech" and that didn't help. So far the only thing that seemed to help was replacing the batteries. I'm still having the problem but not to the extent that I was before.

I did a quick Google search and it turns out I'm not the only one having this problem. There was something posted to the <a href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-With-Mac/MX-Revolution-double-clicking/m-p/390631" target="_blank">Logitech Forums</a> which just says they are having a problem. No resolutions so far. There is also a lengthy discussion on <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=791775" target="_blank">MacRumors</a> which has shown that Leopard is not having this issue, only Snow Leopard. It also ruled out users who upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard. It also ruled out, then ruled back in, a Logitech driver issue.

So far, like I said, changing the batteries seems to work. I don't know what the batteries have to do with the single vs. double click though. Sounds like a driver issue though. If it is an Apple issue, hopefully the 10.6.2 build will fix this. If it is a Logitech issue, I have my Logitech Control Center set to automatically update so now it is just a waiting game.

[Update 10/19/2009 @7:24 PST] Changing the batteries didn't help for very long. It worked for maybe a day then went back to double clicking everything. I've been using my Mighty Mouse and it's been working like a champ. So it looks like it is a Logitech driver issue.
