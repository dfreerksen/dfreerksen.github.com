Something that's been bothering me lately is the fact that, in forms, I can't tab through all of the form elements. It completely skips checkboxes and radio buttons. It does this in both Safari and Firefox. I thought it was a preferences issue in the browsers. I searched through the preferences and got nowhere. It turns out it is a system issue, not a browser issue. And there is a simple way to correct the issue.

Open the System Preferences and go to Keyboard & Mouse. Click on the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. At the bottom there is a radio button for "Text boxes and lists only" and "All controls." Select "All controls."

This worked for me in both Safari and Firefox without having to restart Finder.
