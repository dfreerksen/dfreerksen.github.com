I found a new movie I want to see. It's called <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/therocker/" target="_blank">The Rocker</a>. It comes out August 1st, 2008. It's about a high school band that is playing at the Prom. But the drummer can't play because he got suspended so they ask one of their uncles to play the drums. The uncle was in a famous rock back 20 years earlier. The uncle, by the way, is a complete moron. Along the way they get famous. You have to see the <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/therocker/" target="_blank">trailer</a>. It looks really funny.
