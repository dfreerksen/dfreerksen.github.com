I have a theory. It's rough and not at all fully developed yet.

Well, today is St. Patrick's Day. Happy St. Patrick's Day by the way! I woke up this morning thinking about relationships and the economy. And I started thinking that because the economy is so bad, people will soon start staying home instead of going to clubs in order to save money. When people start doing this, social networks like <a href="http://www.myspace.com" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and even <a href="http://www.hotornot.com" target="_blank">HotOrNot</a> and <a href="http://www.craigslist.com" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> will start growing in popularity again. Which means there will start seeing a lot more relationships that were originated online.

I think this will all start with guys first. Generally it's the guys that go out and spend more money at the clubs than the women do. Let's face it, women can get in a lot of clubs for free and guys even buy women drinks. So when guys start feeling the financial pressure, they'll start skipping going out. After a while, women will start doing the same because there aren't any guys at the clubs.

And that's about as far as my thought process has taken me. Any thoughts?
