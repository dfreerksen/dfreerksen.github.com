"This is how our grunts fight in Afghanistan. As you read, you will be exhausted, and above all, proud that these dauntless men guard our country." - Bing West, National Bestselling Author

VICTORY POINT recounts the amazing story of the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Regiment (2/3) during Operations Red Wings and Whalers in the summer of 2005, where the Marines ultimately destroyed a ruthless Taliban- and Al Qaeda-linked insurgency cell led by a terrorist named Ahmad Shah.  
Little has been comprehensively written about Red Wings, and virtually nothing has been disclosed or written about Operation Whalers, the subsequent mission, which yielded a vastly different outcome than that of Red Wings.

Semper Fi!
