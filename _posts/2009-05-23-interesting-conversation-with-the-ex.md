I went to the mall this weekend for a couple of reasons. First of all, I am always on the lookout for dress shirts. I don't wear dress shirts very often but I like the way I look and the way I feel in dress shirts. And then if I find one I like, then I have to buy a tie to go with it. I also wanted to go to the toy store to indulge in my newest obsession; Nerf guns. I bought a Nerf machine gun the other day and it's just so much fun playing with it. Apparently I'm building an arsenal.

While I was walking through the mall I saw someone I hadn't seen in a while. It was my ex-girlfriend. I don't really want anything to do with her so I pretend to not notice her. That didn't work because she called out my name. She was with her new boyfriend. I guess she wanted to show him off in front of me to make me jealous. It didn't really work out the way she wanted.

Let me start off by saying that I'm a pretty fit guy. I work out and I eat right. My chest puffs out a little bit. My health and my body are important to me. I even wear medium t-shirts to show off a little sometimes.

Her new boyfriend had to have a good 30-40 pounds on me. With the workings of a double chin, a ketchup or BBQ sauce stained white t-shirt, and a two day old patchy beard.

So we are doing the usually chit chat/catch up talk. You know, "How have you been?" That kind of thing. Out of the corner of my I see him looking me up and down. A few seconds later I see him suck in his gut a little which puffed out his chest.

I guess I intimidated the guy. He didn't do a very good job of hiding it either. I just looked at him and smiled. Then said I had to get going. I didn't say anything mean to either one of them. That whole situation was totally worth her calling out my name.
