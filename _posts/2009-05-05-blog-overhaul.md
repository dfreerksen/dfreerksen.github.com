I started on a new blog, as you can see. The old blog I wrote myself and it was more irritating and clunky than useful. This one is using a ColdFusion blog application called <a href="http://www.cfbloggy.com/" target="_blank">CFBloggy</a>. So far I am happy with it. So be patient with me while I get everything up and running. The old blog posts, more than likely, will not be ported over to this one. They are lost forever. By the way, this is the new address to my blog. Eventually the old one will redirect you here. That will happen when I get v3 of the site up. This is step one towards v3 of my site.
