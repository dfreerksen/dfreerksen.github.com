I had my second session with my trainer today. We worked chest and triceps. Somehow, trainers have a way of making you feel like a complete weakling. I am use to doing four full sets of 70lb dumbbells in each hand on incline. He made me change my form just a little and suddenly the 30's were kicking my ass. I don't care though. Anything to get me down to my goal of 12% body fat.
