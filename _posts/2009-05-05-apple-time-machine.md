At work the other day they gave me an external hard drive so I can start saving things on to. I didn't really think much about it, so i just plugged it in and forgot about it. After a while I I went back to one of my Spaces and saw a window I had never seen before. It said "Time Machine Backup" and "Backing up x items".

It turns out when I plugged in the external hard drive it saw it has a backup disk and starting saving backup files. So I started reading up on it. Time Machine is actually really cool! It's something similar to Subversion. But instead of manually committing files, Time Machine backs up all of your files on an interval. So of course I had to go out and buy an external hard drive for my home computer.

Just another reason I love Mac!
