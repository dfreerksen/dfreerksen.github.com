<a href="http://pcheese.net/software/soundstream/" target="_blank">Soundstream</a> is a free screensaver for Mac OS X that responds to sound input. When the screensaver is on, it listens for sounds around the computer using the microphone. The louder the sound the more spectacular the visualization. So if you have music playing, the screensaver will pulse to music. You can get the latest version from <a href="http://macupdate.com/info.php/id/20086" target="_blank">MacUpdate</a>.
