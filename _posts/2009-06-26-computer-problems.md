I had computer issues on Friday. I had an old external drive that I had a bunch of files on. The drive is going slow so I think it is about to die. I needed to copy a bunch of the files from the external drive and on to a network drive. I thought it might be a little smarter if I copied the files from the external drive to my computer and then from my computer to the network drive. It was 40 Gb but I thought it might be less time doing that. I was wrong. Apparently it was going to take 11,305 hours. Except it errored out after abut an hour.

At the same time this was going on, I decided to empty my trash. It usually takes me a while to empty so it can get pretty big. This time I had 32,047 files in my trash can.
