This is probably old news for everyone. <a href="http://blog.everythingflex.com/" target="_blank">EverythingFlex</a> has a great, free SWC library for AIR called <a href="http://blog.everythingflex.com/air-central/everythingflexair1swc/" target="_blank">everythingflexairlib.swc</a>. It includes ContextWindow, AlertWindow, NativeAlertWindow, SuperWindow, ConnectionManager, and UpdateManager classes. I won't go into explaining what each one does. You really have to see for yourself. They are amazing. There is even source code for each one to get you started.
