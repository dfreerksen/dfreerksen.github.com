I've been slacking a little on writing about the events in my life. I had two other sessions with the trainer at 24 Hour Fitness that I never even mentioned. It went good. But the biggest news I have had recently is the company I worked for in Plano, <a href="http://www.clickmotive.com/" target="_blank">ClickMotive</a>, flew me there for the company pool party. These guys are awesome. I still do a little bit of freelance work for them. They flew me out there because they still consider me part of the company. They eventually want me to go back there but that's beside the point. I had a lot of fun. I got to see old friends. Meet new people. All of them just as geeky as I am.
