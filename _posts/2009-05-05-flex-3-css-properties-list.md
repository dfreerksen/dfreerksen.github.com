I just found <a href="http://www.loscavio.com/downloads/blog/flex3_css_list/flex3_css_list.htm" target="_blank">this</a> and thought it was pretty nice to have. It's a list of all of the available styles for all of the Flex components. It's not a guide. You can always use intellisense or the Design view to style the components visually. You can even use the <a href="http://examples.adobe.com/flex3/consulting/styleexplorer/Flex3StyleExplorer.html" target="_blank">Flex Style Explorer</a> which does the same thing. I just thought it was a nice reference.
