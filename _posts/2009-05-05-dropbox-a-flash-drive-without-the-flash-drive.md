A while back <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> held a private beta. I missed out on that by about 3 days. That's what I get for being lazy and procrastinating.  
Well, yesterday they came out of private beta. <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is a little similar to <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a> but without merging. Better yet, think if it as a flash drive that you don't have to carry around.

<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is a freeware application that  
instantaneously backs up and syncs your files over the internet and to  
any computer. After you install, it will create a  
folder on your hard drive. Any file you put inside that folder  
will automatically be synced and monitored for changes, and each time a  
change is saved, it backs up and syncs the file again over all of the machines connected to that folder. <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> even does revision history. So if you accidentally saved a file and  
wanted to revert to an old version or deleted a file, <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> can  
recover the previous version.

<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> even has a web interface so if you are on a machine that doesn't have the <a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> software installed you can still work with your files and even add files.

<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_blank">DropBox</a> is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and is free to sign up and allows up to 2Gb for a free account. Paid accounts are coming soon.
