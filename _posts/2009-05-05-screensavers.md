I've never been a big fan of screensavers. For the most part I never really cared what my screensaver was. I usually left it to whatever the default was. Probably a year ago a co-worker told me about a screensaver call <a href="http://www.electricsheep.org/" target="_blank">Electric Sheep</a> (Mac, Windows, Linux). I think that's about the time I actually started caring what my screensaver was. Between then and now I got a Mac.

The first screensavers I found for it was called <a href="http://pcheese.net/software/soundstream/" target="_blank">Soundstream</a> (Mac), which I <a href="{% post_url 2009-05-05-soundstream %}" target="_self">blogged about</a> not too long ago. Soundstream reacts to noise around the computer to create explosions of light. Very cool screensaver.

Recently I found a few more screensavers, all made by <a href="http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/" target="_blank">White Knight Logic</a>. My personal favorite is called <a href="http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/code.php?9" target="_blank">Strands</a> (Mac, Windows). It is simple a bunch of strands of string that glow that move across the screen. Click on the link. It's a lot cooler than I make it sound. A couple other cool screensavers are <a href="http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/code.php?1" target="_blank">Metamercury</a> and <a href="http://www.whiteknightlogic.net/code.php?7" target="_blank">Filigree</a> (both Mac, Windows).

If you really like the Windows Vista bubbles screensaver, Mac has one too, call <a href="http://www.eisbox.net/dev/bubbles-x/" target="_blank">Bubbles X</a>.

<a href="http://www.9031.com/downloads/screensavers.html" target="_blank">Briblo</a> (Mac, Windows) is a pretty nice screensaver. It builds Legos on your screen. <a href="http://www.9031.com/downloads/screensavers.html" target="_blank">Fliqlo</a> (Mac, Windows) is a nice, simple screensaver too. It is a flip clock similar to the evil ones that you always see at the DMV.

Do you like the nebula wallpaper that comes with Mac? I do. Then <a href="http://www.discobrick.com/" target="_blank">DiscoBrick</a> (Mac) may be for you. It uses over 70 3D nebula images and zooms through them like a starship would fly through space.

Next up is the <a href="http://www.fruitz-of-dojo.de/php/download.php4?dlnr=1" target="_blank">Plasma Tunnel</a> (Mac) which makes a black hole type tunnel but with bright colors like plasma.

The last two screensavers I just found today. The first is called <a href="http://uri.cat/software/Anemona/" target="_blank">An√®mona</a> (Mac). It mimics a large body of water in the way that the particle movements are fluid. It is similar to the next screensaver, however it's motions are random. The final screensaver is <a href="http://uri.cat/software/LiquidMac/" target="_blank">LiquidMac</a> (Mac). It requires a laptop computer with a motion enabled sensor (MacBook family, MacBook Pro family, and some of the latest PowerBooks). It mimics the behavior of liquid by creating a particle system that reacts to the computer's orientation. Meaning that the way you tilt the computer the particles will move according to the way you tilted it.
