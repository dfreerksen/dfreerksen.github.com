<img class="size-full wp-image-201 alignleft" title="Smart Grid" src="/assets/images/posts/2009/04/smart_grid.jpg" alt="Smart Grid" width="322" height="346" />A <a href="http://www.joshadamboyd.com/" target="_blank">friend of mine</a> sent me a link today of a really cool site. It's called the <a href="http://ge.ecomagination.com/smartgrid/?c_id=Huff#/augmented_reality" target="_blank">Smart Grid Augmented Reality</a>.

What you do is print out a piece of paper. Once it is printed out, you click on either "Wind Turbine" or "Solar Energy" on the site. This will open up a new window that will connect to your webcam. Hold the printed piece of paper up to the webcam and watch what happens.

The picture you printed will fold out and build a scene for you. You can turn and tilt the piece of paper and it will turn and tilt along with you.

There is even a link to the source code using the <a href="http://www.libspark.org/wiki/saqoosha/FLARToolKit/en" target="_blank">FLARToolKit</a> so you can build your own if you want.
