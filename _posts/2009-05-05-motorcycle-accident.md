Saturday I was involved in my very first motorcycle accident. Yeah for me! I'm not a n00b anymore! So here is the story:

Saturday morning I got on my motorcycle and went out to look at apartments. I am apartment hunting because I don't want to live in the ghetto anymore. I went to an apartment, took a quick tour, wasn't impressed and left. There is a grocery store with a Jamba Juice two blocks from that apartment. I rode there to get a Jamba Juice but decided I really didn't want one once I got there. So I turned around and started heading back to look at more apartments. This is where it all happened.
